"  BASICS

"  vim-sensible " sensible set of defaults
"
" Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of
" defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
"
" * If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
"   copying some random vimrc you found.
"
" * If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
"   can be your neutral territory.
"
" * If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusive
"   yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
"
" * If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from
"   your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic
"   amenities.
